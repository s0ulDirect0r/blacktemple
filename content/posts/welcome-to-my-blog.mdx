# Welcome!

This is my first blog post on my new site. I'm building this as part of my bootcamp journey, and I'm excited to share what I'm learning along the way.

## What I'll Write About

I'm planning to write about:

- **Code concepts** I'm learning in my bootcamp
- **Projects** I'm building (big and small)
- **Challenges** I encounter and how I solve them
- **Resources** that help me learn

## Why Write?

Writing helps me:

1. Solidify my understanding
2. Track my progress
3. Build a portfolio
4. Help others who are learning

## The Tech Stack

This site is built with:

```typescript
const techStack = {
  framework: "Next.js 15",
  language: "TypeScript",
  styling: "Tailwind CSS",
  database: "PostgreSQL",
  hosting: "Vercel"
};
```

Pretty cool, right? I'm learning a lot by building it.

## What's Next?

I'm planning to write weekly posts documenting my learning journey. Stay tuned for posts about:

- React hooks deep dives
- Building REST APIs
- Database design patterns
- And much more!

Thanks for reading, and see you in the next post!
