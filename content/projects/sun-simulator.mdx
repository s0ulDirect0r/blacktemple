# Sun Simulator

An interactive 3D simulation of stellar lifecycle, from the gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud through main sequence stability, red giant expansion, supernova explosion, and the formation of a black hole with gravitational lensing effects.

## Features

- **Nebula Collapse**: 100,000+ particles coalescing under simplified gravitational physics with dynamic velocity and acceleration
- **Stellar Evolution**: Smooth transitions through main sequence, red giant, and supernova phases with volumetric layering and custom corona effects
- **Supernova Event**: Explosive particle ejection with velocity-based coloring, shockwave expansion, and dramatic camera choreography
- **Black Hole Formation**: Real-time gravitational lensing using custom fragment shaders with accretion disk particle system
- **Interactive Camera**: Smooth orbital controls with phase-specific positioning and zoom

## Technical Highlights

Built with modern graphics programming techniques:

- **Three.js** for 3D scene management and WebGL abstraction
- **Custom GLSL shaders** for gravitational lensing post-processing effects
- **Particle systems** optimized for 100k+ simultaneous particles with BufferGeometry
- **Simplex noise** for procedural nebula generation and stellar surface detail
- **Physics simulation** with simplified n-body gravity for visual drama over accuracy
- **Post-processing pipeline** with bloom, glow, and custom lens effects

## What I Learned

Building this project taught me:

1. Advanced Three.js techniques (particle systems, custom materials, post-processing)
2. GLSL shader programming for visual effects (gravitational lensing, volumetrics)
3. Real-time performance optimization (particle culling, LOD, efficient updates)
4. Physics simulation basics (gravitational acceleration, velocity integration)
5. Animation choreography (camera transitions, particle behavior synchronization)
6. Complex state management for multi-phase simulations

## Performance Considerations

- Maintains 60 FPS with 100,000 particles on modern hardware
- Uses BufferGeometry and instancing for efficient GPU utilization
- Implements particle recycling during phase transitions
- Optimized shader uniforms and minimal state changes per frame

This project demonstrates both technical graphics programming skill and creative visual design, balancing scientific inspiration with cinematic impact.
