# The Black Temple

This is my personal portfolio site where I showcase my creative work across multiple mediums - digital art, technical writing, and code projects.

## Features

- **Art Gallery**: A responsive grid gallery for displaying digital artwork with metadata management
- **Blog**: Weekly technical writing posts with MDX support and syntax highlighting
- **Projects Showcase**: Grid display of coding projects with tech stack tags
- **Admin Panel**: JWT-authenticated admin interface for managing content

## Technical Highlights

Built with modern web technologies:

- **Next.js 15** with App Router for server-side rendering
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **PostgreSQL** (Neon) for data persistence
- **Vercel Blob** for image storage
- **MDX** for content management

## What I Learned

Building this project taught me:

1. Full-stack Next.js development
2. Database schema design and migrations
3. JWT authentication
4. File upload and storage
5. Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
6. MDX integration for content

## Future Improvements

- Add full-text search for blog posts
