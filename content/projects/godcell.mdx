# GODCELL

An evolutionary survival game set in a hostile digital world. You start as a tiny, desperate single-cell organism competing for scarce nutrients. Survive entropy swarms, avoid gravity wells, and evolve through increasingly powerful forms—or die and lose everything.

## Core Concept

The game models evolutionary pressure to create emergent gameplay: scarcity forces competition, predation creates tension, and the constant threat of entropy keeps you moving. You don't learn from tutorials—you learn by dying.

## Technical Architecture

Built with a custom Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture running on both client and server:

- **Client:** Three.js rendering with custom particle systems and visual effects
- **Server:** Authoritative game state with Socket.io for real-time networking
- **Shared:** Monorepo structure with common types and ECS core shared between client and server

## Key Features

- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Compete against other players in a shared world
- **Evolution System**: Progress through multiple stages, each with unique abilities
- **Environmental Hazards**: Navigate entropy swarms, gravity wells, and resource scarcity
- **Emergent Gameplay**: No scripted encounters—all tension emerges from game mechanics

## What I'm Learning

This project is pushing me into:

1. Real-time multiplayer game architecture and state synchronization
2. Entity-Component-System design patterns at scale
3. Three.js performance optimization for many simultaneous entities
4. Server authoritative game design to prevent cheating
5. WebSocket networking patterns and latency compensation
